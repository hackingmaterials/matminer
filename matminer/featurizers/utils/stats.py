class PropertyStats:
    """This class contains statistical operations that are commonly employed
    when computing features.

    The primary way for interacting with this class is to call the
    ``calc_stat`` function, which takes the name of the statistic you would
    like to compute and the weights/values of data to be assessed. For example,
    computing the mean of a list looks like::

        x = [1, 2, 3]
        PropertyStats.calc_stat(x, 'mean') # Result is 2
        PropertyStats.calc_stat(x, 'mean', weights=[0, 0, 1]) # Result is 3

    Some of the statistics functions take options (e.g., Holder means). You can
    pass them to the statistics functions by adding them after the name and
    two colons. For example, the 0th Holder mean would be::

        PropertyStats.calc_stat(x, 'holder_mean::0')

    You can, of course, call the statistical functions directly. All take at
    least two arguments.  The first is the data being assessed and the second,
    optional, argument is the weights.
