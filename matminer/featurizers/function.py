    Features from functions applied to existing features, e.g. "1/x"

    This featurizer must be fit either by calling .fit_featurize_dataframe
    or by calling .fit followed by featurize_dataframe.

    This class featurizes a dataframe according to a set
    of expressions representing functions to apply to
    existing features. The approach here has uses a sympy-based
    parsing of string expressions, rather than explicit
    python functions.  The primary reason this has been
    done is to provide for better support for book-keeping
    (e. g. with feature labels), substitution, and elimination
    of symbolic redundancy, which sympy is well-suited for.


    Note original feature names in the resulting feature set
    will have their sympy-illegal characters substituted with
    underscores. For example:

    "exp(-MagpieData_avg_dev_NfValence)/sqrt(MagpieData_range_Number)"

    Where the original feature names were

    "MagpieData avg_dev NfValence"  and "MagpieData range Number"

        multi_feature_depth (int): how many features to include if using
            multiple fields for functionalization, e. g. 2 will
            include pairwise combined features
        postprocess (function or type): type to cast functional outputs
            to, if, for example, you want to include the possibility of
            complex numbers in your outputs, use postprocess=np.complex,
            defaults to float
        combo_function (function): function to combine multi-features,
            defaults to np.prod (i.e. cumulative product of expressions),
            note that a combo function must cleanly process sympy
            expressions and **takes a list of arbitrary length as input**,
