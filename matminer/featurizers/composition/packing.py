    """
    Packing efficiency based on a geometric theory of the amorphous packing
    of hard spheres.

    This featurizer computes two different kinds of the features. The first
    relate to the distance between a composition and the composition of
    the clusters of atoms expected to be efficiently packed based on a
    theory from
    `Laws et al.<http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms9123>`_.
    The second corresponds to the packing efficiency of a system if all atoms
    in the alloy are simultaneously as efficiently-packed as possible.

    The packing efficiency in these models is based on the Atomic Packing
    Efficiency (APE), which measures the difference between the ratio of
    the radii of the central atom to its neighbors and the ideal ratio
    of a cluster with the same number of atoms that has optimal packing
    efficiency. If the difference between the ratios is too large, the APE is
    positive. If the difference is too small, the APE is negative.

    Features:
        dist from {k} clusters |APE| < {thr} - The distance between an
            alloy composition and the k clusters that have a packing efficiency
            below thr from ideal
        mean simul. packing efficiency - Mean packing efficiency of all atoms.
            The packing efficiency is measured with respect to ideal (0)
        mean abs simul. packing efficiency - Mean absolute value of the
            packing efficiencies. Closer to zero is more efficiently packed
