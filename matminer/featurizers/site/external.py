class SOAP(BaseFeaturizer):
    """
    Smooth overlap of atomic positions (interface via DScribe).

    Class for generating a partial power spectrum from Smooth Overlap of Atomic
    Orbitals (SOAP). This implementation uses real (tesseral) spherical
    harmonics as the angular basis set and provides two orthonormalized
    alternatives for the radial basis functions: spherical primitive gaussian
    type orbitals ("gto") or the polynomial basis set ("polynomial"). By
    default the faster gto-basis is used. Please see the DScribe SOAP
    documentation for more details.

    Note that SOAP is only featurized for elements identified by "fit" (see
    following), thus "fit" must be called before "featurize", or else an error
    will be raised.

    Args:
        rcut (float): A cutoff for local region in angstroms. Should be
            bigger than 1 angstrom.
        nmax (int): The number of radial basis functions.
        lmax (int): The maximum degree of spherical harmonics.
        sigma (float): The standard deviation of the gaussians used to expand the
            atomic density.
        rbf (str): The radial basis functions to use. The available options are:

            * "gto": Spherical gaussian type orbitals defined as :math:`g_{nl}(r) = \\sum_{n'=1}^{n_\\mathrm{max}}\\,\\beta_{nn'l} r^l e^{-\\alpha_{n'l}r^2}`
            * "polynomial": Polynomial basis defined as :math:`g_{n}(r) = \\sum_{n'=1}^{n_\\mathrm{max}}\\,\\beta_{nn'} (r-r_\\mathrm{cut})^{n'+2}`

        periodic (bool): Determines whether the system is considered to be
            periodic.
        crossover (bool): Determines if crossover of atomic types should
            be included in the power spectrum. If enabled, the power
            spectrum is calculated over all unique species combinations Z
            and Z'. If disabled, the power spectrum does not contain
            cross-species information and is only run over each unique
            species Z. Turned on by default to correspond to the original
            definition. Deprecated in DScribe 2.1 and replace with general
            'compression' parameter (see below).
        compression (dict): Contains the options which specify the feature compression to apply.
            See DScribe documentation for details.
