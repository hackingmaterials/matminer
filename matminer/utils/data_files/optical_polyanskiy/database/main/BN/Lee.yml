COMMENTS: "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). In-plane refractive index (ordinary ray, n<sub>o</sub>). h-BN flakes of thickness around 1000 nm were mechanically exfoliated from a bulk crystal and transferred onto quartz substrates for transmission measurements. The single oscillator model is used to fit transmission spectra of several hBN flakes of different thickness."
