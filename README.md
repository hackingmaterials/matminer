Matminer helps users apply methods and data sets developed by the community. Please also cite the original sources, as this will add clarity to your article and credit the original authors:

- If you use one or more **datasets** accessed through matminer, check the dataset metadata info for relevant citations on the original datasets.
- If you use one or more **data retrieval methods**, check ``citations()`` method of the data retrieval class. This method will provide a list of BibTeX-formatted citations for that featurizer, making it easy to keep track of and cite the original publications.
- If you use one or more **featurizers**, please take advantage of the ```citations()``` function present for every featurizer in matminer.
